Whirlpool Corporation, along with Purdue University, will transform an existing home near Purdueâ€™s campus into a world class research laboratory and sustainable living showcase. ReNEWW House will provide valuable insights for our homebuilder partners and customers on technologies that enable sustainable living. We will leverage the world class facilities and collaborate with Purdue researchers to accelerate the development of the next generation of ultra-high efficiency appliances that increase core performance while lowering their impact on the environment and cost to operate.
