        <p id="aboutWerld">With its first class in 1989, the WERLD Program has been a premier engineering rotational training program that has been developing world-class engineering leaders through challenging assignments, global team projects, integrated training and development, and formal coaching and mentoring programs. WERLD participants gain a thorough introduction to engineering and technology from a global product perspective, through the opportunity to work in several functional assignments including: Product Development, Research & Development, Systems Engineering, Product Testing & Approval and Lab Operations, Engineering Capability, Consumer Science, Product Quality and Manufacturing. WERLD Engineers go through four 6-month rotations which are selected based on their educational background & experiences, career interests, and personal development goals. The rotations give them the opportunity to explore different areas of engineering, different stages of product development or several different product categories that Whirlpool has to offer. After the first 2 years, WERLD engineers have the opportunity for continuing education to pursue a technical Masters degree at Purdue University.</p>
